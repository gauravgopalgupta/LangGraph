Subject: Apologies for Inability to Attend the Morning Meeting and Availability for the Evening

Dear Manisha,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to reach out and let you know that unfortunately, I won't be able to make it to the 
upcoming meeting scheduled for 10:00 AM. I understand the importance of your gathering and the 
value it brings to our team. However, due to an unforeseen circumstance, I will be unable to join 
you in person during the morning session.

I would, however, like to offer my availability for the evening session, should it be convenient 
for everyone. The time that works best for me would be 3:30 PM. I am more than willing to 
contribute in any way I can and ensure a productive session. If the evening time isn't suitable, 
please let me know, and I'll do my best to find another solution.

Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience my absence during the morning may cause, and I 
appreciate your understanding in this matter. I'll make sure to catch up on any important 
takeaways and next steps following the meeting.

Best regards,

Gaurav
